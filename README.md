## Quick start

Do you want to test the application quickly, and you do not have a ready API? No problem, you can use the ready-made example in the **examples** folder. The API for this example is available on the internet, so you can connect to it by entering its address in the configuration file.

### Steps

- Select template from **examples** folder you want to use, e.g. **examples/simple-crud**. Then:
- Copy **examples/simple-crud/public** folder to the root directory,
- Copy the rest of files and folders (**config**, **locales**, **routes**, **main.js**, **router.js**) from **examples/simple-crud** folder to the **src** directory,
- If you have your own API prepared, modify **src/config/api.js** file,
- Type following commands:

``` console
yarn
:: or
npm install
```
and then:
``` console
yarn serve
:: or
npm run serve
```
... and your app is already running (probably at http://localhost:8080).

## API
The application requires a connection with the appropriate API. API can be created in any technology - the condition is its compliance with the Vue CRUD communication specification. If you need to create your API and do not know how to get started, and you don't mind PHP and Laravel, download or clone the <a href="https://github.com/szczepanmasny/vue-crud-laravel-api" target="_blank">Vue CRUD Laravel API project</a>.
