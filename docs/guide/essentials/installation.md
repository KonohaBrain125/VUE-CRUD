## Creating a new project

Vue CRUD is an application template, not a library, so it can not be added as a library in dependencies.\
To set up a new project, you must download it or clone from the <a href="https://github.com/szczepanmasny/vue-crud" target="_blank">repository on GitHub</a>.

## Dependencies installation

Before you start working on a project, you need to install dependencies from the package.json file in your project. To do this, use the command line to enter the project location, and then enter one of the following commands:

```
npm install
# or
yarn
```

::: warning
To use 'yarn' command you must have <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" target="_blank">yarn</a> installed.
