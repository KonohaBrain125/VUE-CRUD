# Introduction

## About

### What is Vue CRUD?

Vue CRUD is a system based on Vue.js, Vuex and Vuetify. It can used to create applications such as CRMs and CMSs based on CRUD (create, read update, and delete). The application created with the help of Vue CRUD works as a SPA (Single Page Application) and communicates with the server via the API.

### Functions

Vue CRUD provides a set of utilities, from which you can compose your own application. Features included in the system can communicate with each other thanks to the use of the Vuex library. Vue CRUD includes the following elements:
